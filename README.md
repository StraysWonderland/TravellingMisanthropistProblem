[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2cb247439cd4468d9493897cf4561ad4)](https://app.codacy.com/app/cagri.c.tasci/TravellingMisanthropistProblem?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=StraysWonderland/TravellingMisanthropistProblem&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)
[![GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/assets/badge.svg)](https://gitpitch.com/StraysWonderland/TMP_Pitch)


Web application that, given a location, computes a round trip along nearby amenities based on a specified ranking.
As misanthropist, one might want to go for a roundtrip among nearby bars but also avoid being in crowded places, and people in general, whenever possible.
Thus, pick the bars with the lowest possiblity of being crowded.
Bars with a generaly low ranking should in theory be visited less.

This project is split into two git repositories
* [Parser](https://github.com/StraysWonderland/TMP_Parser)
* [(Springboot Web) Application](https://github.com/StraysWonderland/TravellingMisanthropistProblem)

Access the gitpitch-presentation about this project via button above, or via the [TMP_Pitch](https://github.com/StraysWonderland/TMP_Pitch) repository.

## PARSER
To run parser, place a pbf file in the root directory and name it 'target.osm.pbf'.
Run the jar file preferably by running the command:
   >  java -jar -Xmx=\<AllocatedRAM> \<JARNAME> \<name of pfb file>
   
*   \<JARNAME> should be TMPParser.jar, lying in the root of the directory
*   \<name of pbf file> should usually be 'ger.osm.pbf' or 'bw.osm.pbf' or define the path, if file lies somewhere else.
*   \<allocatedRam> shout at least be 16G

Example:
   >  java -jar -Xmx=20G TMPParser.jar ger.osm.pbf

Alternatively, launch intelliJ and run the application (set jav heapspace accordingly via Help -> customVMoptions -> Xmxs)

### Created Files
The parser will create to files under TMPParser\ressources.

*   Rename these files to 'de.osm.edges' and 'de.osm.nodes' (only if this is not already the case)
*   Copy the files to the project directory of the actual application and place them in TravellingMisanthropistProblem\ressources. 
(two already parsed files for stuttgart can be found here as well)

## HOW TO START THE PROJECT

### Method 1: IDE
open the 'TravelingMisanthropistProblem' Folder in IntelliJ-Idea and Run it.

### Method 2: JAR
To run the code from jar

*   open the 'TravelingMisanthropistProblem' Folder in Explorer,
*   Open cmd window in that Folder,
*   type and run following command:

    >  ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments="-Xmx16G" -Drun.profiles=dev

## Using the Project
once the project has started, open a browser and navigate to 

   >  [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Either allow locating via gps or click anywhere on the map to set your current location.

### TSP
First, press the 'get nearby bars' button to retrieve nearby amenities.
A set of markers will be placed on the map.
Left click each marker to show a popup containing information about selected bar.
Right click a marker to select it as desired target of the roundtrip. 
Richt clicking shows following information about an amenity

![Popup information](images/hereNow.PNG "Popup info")

Once you have selected more than one marker, you can press the now appearing 'calculate roundtrip' and the route will be displayed.
![Generated Roundtrip](images/roundtrip.PNG "Popup roundtrip")
#### Ranked-TSP
instead of selecting bars by hand, use the 'ranked Roundtrip' button to generate a tour to the least visited bars, ranked via foursquare.
Specify the number of bars to visit by editing 'bars' input field.
Input any number from 2 to 23.

### Dijkstra
Place an additional marker via corresponding button, then press 'calculate path' to display the shortest path between both markers

## Additional Notes
*   The project contains resource files to handle Baden-WÃ¼rrtemberg.
*   If instead of germany, Stuttgart (already existing in the repo) should be used (when less ram is available), rename the existing files (in \./ressources) to 'de.osm.nodes' and 'de.osm.edges'.

## Implementation Details
*   Java for Backend
*   Leaflet for map visualisation
*   Javascript for map interaction
*   Java Springboot to bundle into web-application
*   Map-Data from OpenStreetMaps
*   Data for POIs from Foursquare API

## Project Goal and Problem Definition
### General procedure
*   Parse osm file to retrieve edges and node.
*   Read file and generate grid for fast access
*   Visualise map
*   Retrieve nearby amenities from [foursquare API](https://de.foursquare.com/)
*   Calculate dijkstra between two points
*   Calculate TSP for selected amenities.
*   Calculate TSP by selecting Bars with the lowest rating across all possible closeby bars.

### TSP
*   Calculation via [HeldKarp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Held%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) -dynamic programming- algorithm

### Ranked TSP
*   Retrieves a set of properties such as 'users that are here now', 'user rating' ... from the foursquare API
*   Sorts retrieved amenities based on a rating generated from these properties (the lower the amount of people currently visiting, the better)
*   Calculate TSP along the 'top' k-bars, where top refers to those with the least possibility of being crowded.
